            Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite the nation.
            He sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands.
            Some of these were of general interest; others were specific demands of different 
            classes, from industrialists to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging,
            so that all classes within Indian society could identify with them and everyone could be 
            brought together in a united campaign. The most stirring of all was the demand to abolish
            the salt tax. Salt was something consumed by the rich and the poor alike, and it was one of 
            the most essential items of food. The tax on salt and the government monopoly over its production,
            Mahatma Gandhi declared, revealed the most oppressive face of British rule. Mahatma Gandhi’s 
            letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the demands were not fulfilled on time, the letter stated,
            the Congress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was unwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi 
            started his famous salt march accompanied by some of his trusted volunteers. The volunteers walked for twenty four days, 
            about ten miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant
            by swaraj and urged them to peacefully defy the British.He ceremonially violated after the law, manufacturing salt 
            by boiling sea water. This marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
